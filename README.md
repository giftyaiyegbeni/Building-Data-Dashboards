# Building-Data-Dashboards

In this project, I created visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. 
The data visualizations were created to tell a story and highlight patterns in the data set. 
My work was a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication using Tableau.
