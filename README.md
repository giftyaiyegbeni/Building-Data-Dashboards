# Building-Data-Dashboards

In this project, I created visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. 
The data visualizations were created to tell a story and highlight patterns in the data set. 
My work was a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication using Tableau.

The document showing the visualizations and stating the thought process for the process can be accessed [here]()
